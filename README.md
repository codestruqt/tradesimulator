# TradeSimulator

🔪 A Python-based trade simulator that emulates a real-time trading environment — similar to **Zerodha Kite** — for placing and managing trades on **NSE-like** markets. It is ideal for strategy testing, mock trading, and UI/backend prototyping without using real capital or APIs.


## 🚀 Features

* Simulated trading environment with exchange-like behavior
* Place and manage **Market**, **Limit**, and **Stop** orders
* Track positions, virtual balance, PnL, and trade history
* Works on historical candle/tick data (CSV format)
* Mimics order placement experience of platforms like **Zerodha Kite**
* Lightweight and customizable core engine
